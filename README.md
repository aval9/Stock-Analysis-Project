# Stock-Analysis-Project

This project is part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone and focuses on performing a comprehensive analysis of historical stock data for Tesla and other selected companies. It involves scraping and preprocessing financial data, visualizing trends, and generating insights using Python-based data science tools.

🔍 Project Highlights

- Web Scraping: Extracted Tesla revenue data from Macrotrends using requests, BeautifulSoup, and pandas.
- Data Cleaning: Converted scraped HTML tables into structured DataFrames, cleaned financial figures (e.g., removed dollar signs, commas).
- Data Wrangling: Merged revenue data with historical stock prices pulled from Yahoo Finance using yfinance.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Plotted revenue trends over time and examined how Tesla’s financial growth correlates with stock price movement.
- Tools Used:
- pandas, matplotlib, BeautifulSoup, yfinance, requests
- Jupyter Notebooks (for exploratory and visual analysis)

 📊 Objective

To simulate real-world stock analysis scenarios by combining financial data from multiple sources, applying data science techniques, and visualizing meaningful insights for business or investment decisions.
